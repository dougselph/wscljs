A thin and lightweight websocket client for ClojureScript.

## Usage

    (require '[wscljs.client :as ws]

To create a new websocket connection:

    (def socket (ws/create "ws://...." handlers))

where `handlers` is a map containing handler functions mapped to the following keys:

Required:

  - `:on-message` => called when recieving message on the socket

Optional:

  - `:on-open`    => called when opening a socket connection
  - `:on-close`   => called when closing a socket connection

For example, to print the data received by the socket, do:

    (def handlers {:on-message (fn [e] (prn (.-data e)))
                   :on-open #(prn "Opening a new connection")
                   :on-close #(prn "Closing a connection")})
    (def socket (ws/create "ws://...." handlers))

To send json data over the socket, do:

    (require '[wscljs.format :as fmt])

    (ws/send socket {:command "ping"} fmt/json)

*The supported formats are `json` and `identity` (for now).*

After you're done, close the socket using:

    (ws/close socket)

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

## Testing

To run the tests, do

    lein test
